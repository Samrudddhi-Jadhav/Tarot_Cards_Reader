# Tarot_Cards_Reader
**Tarot Card Project**
This project is a web-based application designed to streamline student admissions and payment processes. Built during my third year of college (2023-2024) as part of a college activity, it showcases my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies to create a functional and user-friendly system.

**Technologies Used**
**HTML:** For structuring the web content.
**CSS:** For designing and styling the website.
**JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.
**XAMPP:** For hosting the application locally and managing backend operations.

**Features**
**Payment Form:** Created using Google Forms to collect student details and payment information.
**Dynamic Design:** Interactive interface for seamless navigation and user experience.
